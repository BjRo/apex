## Apex - Awesome Print for Elixir ##
Awesome Print is an Elixir library that pretty prints Elixir data structures in full color
exposing their internal structure with proper indentation. It's a port of part of the functionality
of Ruby's awesome [awesome_print gem](https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print).

### Installation ###
Add to your mix.exs

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:apex, "~>0.0.1", github: "BjRo/apex"}
    ]
  end
```

### Examples ###

```elixir
data = [ false, 42, %w(forty two), [time: "now"]]

Apex.ap data

[
    [0] false,
    [1] 42,
    [2] [
      [0] "forty",
      [1] "two"
    ],
    [3] [
      [0] time: "now"
