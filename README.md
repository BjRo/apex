## Apex - Awesome Print for Elixir ##
Awesome Print is an Elixir library that pretty prints Elixir data structures in full color
exposing their internal structure with proper indentation. It's a port of part of the functionality
of Ruby's awesome [awesome_print gem](https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print).

### Installation ###
In order to install it via hex, add the reference to this package into the `deps` area of your `mix.exs`.

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:apex, "~>1.2.1"}
    ]
  end
```

### Examples ###

```elixir
data = [false, 42, ~w(forty two), [time: "now"], %{foo: :bar}]

Apex.ap data

# Will output the following:
#[
#   [0] false
#   [1] 42
#   [2] [
#     [0] "forty"
#     [1] "two"
#   ]
#   [3] [
#     [0] time: "now"
#   ]
#   [4] %{
#      foo: bar
#   }
#]
#
#[false, 42, ~w(forty two), [time: "now"], %{foo: :bar}]
```

If the numbering is not for you, you can turn it off via `Apex.ap(data, numbers: false)`.

### Supported types

* BitString
* Integer
* Float
* Atom
* List
* Range
* PID
* Port
* Function
* MapSet
* Map
* Tuple
* Reference
* Elixir Records
* Elixir Structs

`Apex` uses a protocol internally to format a given value. If there's something not yet in the box, you can extend the protocol `Apex.Format`.

### Color customizations
You can customize the `Apex` colors on a per project or global basis. For project
specific color configuration, you can specify the color table in your `config/config.ex`

```elixir
use Mix.Config

config :apex, :colors, %{
  binary: :red
}
```

This can alternatively also be done at runtime by using the `Application.put_env/3` function.

Please note, that you only have to specify the colors you actively want to change here. For
the rest `Apex` will fallback to the defaults.

If you want to apply the same settings across multiple elixir projects, you can drop a `.apexrc`
file into your home directory in order do the same thing. The configuration is an `Elixir` Map.

```elixir
%{
  colors: %{
    binary: :yellow,
    true:   [:green, :bright]
  }
}
```

__IMPORTANT:__ the global configuration will get compiled into your `Apex` version when
you compile your app. You need to recompile `Apex` via `mix deps.compile apex` when
you want to apply changes to the `.apexrc` file.

__PRECEDENCE:__ When both project specific and global configuration
are present, project specific configuration will take precedence.

For a full list of all available customizations, please take a look at the result of `Apex.Format.Color.default_colors/0)`.

### Awesome def aka adef
Inspired by [@sasajuric](https://github.com/sasa1977)'s [awesome blog post series about macros](http://www.theerlangelist.com/search/label/metaprogramming), Apex also contains an Apex flavored version of his `deftracable` macro. By using `adef` instead of `def`

```elixir
import Apex.AwesomeDef
adef test(data, options \\ []) do
  data
end
```

all function invocations print trace outputs in the following format to the group leader (console):

```bash
iex(1)> Apex.test "foo"
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Function Elixir.Apex.test was called
defined in /Users/bjoernrochel/Coding/Laboratory/apex/lib/apex.ex:12
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[
  [0] "foo"
  [1] []
]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"foo"
```
